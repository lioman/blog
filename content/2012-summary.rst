Update: This Plug in is not maintained any more - but something new is coming soon!!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| |Summary 2012|\ I've adapted this Plug in from `2010
  Summary <http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/2010-summary/>`__ by
  `Tomasz Topa <http://tomasz.topa.pl/>`__"
| Now it generates a summary of your WordPress blog for the year 2012.
| See how many posts you wrote during the ending year, which were the
  most popular, who was the most active commenter etc.
| And then share the stats with your readers - copy the data to a new
  draft with a single click.

The plugin is currently developed on
`github <https://github.com/lioman/2012-summary>`__ and hosted in the
`WordPress plugin
directory <https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/2012-summary/>`__.

ToDo:

Add option to choose year
